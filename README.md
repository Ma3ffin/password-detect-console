# password-detect-console

## Some basic information
- Every project is tackled by exactly one student
- Suggestions for own projects cannot be submitted
- Non-code artefacts must be written in LaTeX/English
- Code must be written in a statically typed language (ask!)
- Unless stated otherwise, any software tool is permitted (ask!)
- Points are only given if related tasks are completed
(e.g., documentation can only be graded with implementation)
- If you do not upload your work to Moodle before the deadline,
the grade is 5 - no discussion
- If a part of the assignment does not result from own work
(and is not cited as such), the grade is 5 - no discussion
- Start early and focussed - statements like \I hardly have time
because of my job/master thesis" do not count

## Projekt
Use machine learning to detect if an entered password is indeed from a genuine user - even if the password was correct. You can recognize this by the rhythm of the pressed keys, for example. Upload a prototype (+test data) and a document.
- (10 points) Build a prototype which detects imposters
- (2 points) Include a training option in your prototype
- (2 points) Evaluate your prototype with \real" data
- (2 points) Describe your idea(s) and used algorithm(s)
- (2 points) Include related work/papers in your document
- (2 points) Include an import/export feature for data
